At PPTH, SafeChx has decreased patient check-in time by an average of eleven minutes. It has reduced the risk of fraudulent and denied claims. It has completely eradicated new medical record duplications - PPTH estimates that this saves them $60,000 a year. It is accepted by more than 95% of patients. And it did all of this without disrupting the patient flow.

Amelia Forester brings her mother Jean to PPTH for diabetes treatment. She says "Last year, moms blood sugar dropped too quickly while I was at work and her friend brought her to the emergency room. Thankfully, it wasn't too serious, and they decided to treat mom using food and glucose pills. For some reason, moms medical records that discussed her Celiacs disease weren't showing up for the emergency room doctors. Luckily, Dr. Mann was there, and he remembered that Mom has Celiacs disease, and made sure that she wasn't given anything with gluten to eat, which would have made her even more sick. Now because of SafeChx, all of moms medical records are linked, which will prevent such a near disaster from ever happening again."
