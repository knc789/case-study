<img style="float: left;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knc789/case-study/gh-pages/img/scanner.png"> CrossChx has implemented SafeChx at PPTH. SafeChx works by having a patient check in with their fingerprint. Their unique fingerprint is used to instantly link all of their medical records with their health benefit information. Andy Ulrich says that "It was incredibly easy to implement with our pre-existing system. CrossChx installed it remotely, and it did impact our patient flow. It streamlined it!"

SafeChx is given to hospitals absolutely free, including installation, setup, on-site training, and support.
