Every year, PPTH treats up to 130,000 people in their emergency room, up to 400,000 people in the hospital as a whole, and is the regional expert in pulling people through burn trauma.

PPTH partners with Princeton University School of Medicine to train medical students, interns, residents and fellows.

CrossChx partners with PPTH to improve the efficiency of the patient check in process by instantly verifying a patient's identity, by linking all of their records, and by identifying and preventing duplicate medical records.
