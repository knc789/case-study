At PPTH, SafeChx has decreased patient check-in time by an average of eleven minutes. It has reduced the risk of fraudulent and denied claims. It has completely eradicated new medical record duplications. PPTH estimates that this saves them $45,000 a year. It is accepted by more than 95% of patients. And it did all of this without disrupting the patient flow.

<img style="float: left;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knc789/case-study/gh-pages/img/AmeliaandJean.jpg"> Amelia Forester brings her mother Jane to PPTH for diabetes treatment. Amilia told us, "Last year, Moms blood sugar dropped too quickly while I was at work and her friend brought her to the emergency room. Thankfully, it wasn't too serious, and they decided to treat her using food. For whatever reason, Moms medical records that documented her Celiacs disease weren't showing up in the emergency room documentation. Luckily, Dr. Mann was there, and he remembered that Mom has Celiacs disease, and he made sure that she wasn't given anything with gluten to eat, which would have made her even more sick. Now because of SafeChx, all of Moms medical records are linked, which will prevent something like this from ever happening again."
