PPTH sees an average of 400 people every day in their four trauma centers and five emergency rooms, including a pediatric unit. “If it can happen, we’ll get it,” says Andy Ulrich, a School of Medicine associate professor of emergency medicine, and executive vice chairman of the emergency medicine department. “We never know what’s coming. Every day, every minute, every patient is different.”

PPTH works with [Partnership for a Drug-Free New Jersey](http://www.drugfreenj.org/) to decrease prescription drug abuse issues. With the volume of patients that PPTH sees in a day, they haven't always been able to keep track of those who may be using their system to abuse prescription drugs.

PPTH also wants a way to identify and prevent duplicate medical records. They estimate that fixing duplicate medical records is costing an average of $50 per duplication. This doesn't take into account the time wasted by both the patient and staff to sort out the issues.

PPTH needs a solution that verifies a patient's identity, finds their medical records, and links them all together so that they can practice 'the five R's' to reduce medication errors and harm. The 'five rights' of medication administration are: the right drug, to the right patient, with the right dose, administered through the right route, and at the right time. This solution needs to be easy and non-disruptive to implement, so that the doctors and staff can focus on the important part: the best possible care for their patients.
